# Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 and IBM Watson

Guided project focuses on creating a voice assistant using OpenAI's GPT-3 for natural language understanding and IBM Watson's Speech Libraries for voice interaction. The assistant takes voice input, converts it to text, processes it with GPT-3 for responses, and converts the responses back to speech for the user. This involves building a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a reliable back-end using Python with Flask. By the end, learners gain a deep understanding of voice assistants, web development skills, and a full-stack application to showcase their abilities.
